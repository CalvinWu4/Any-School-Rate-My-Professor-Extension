# Rate-My-Professor-Extension

This Google Chrome extension shows the [Rate My Professors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) rating of professors while searching classes on Tiger Center: https://tigercenter.rit.edu/tigerCenterApp/api/class-search.

Professors' names will now link to their Rate My Professors page (or the search results if not found) instead of to their email. To better find professors, this extension will try all associated nicknames or diminutive names for first names from [here](https://github.com/carltonnorthern/nickname-and-diminutive-names-lookup). For example, Thomas Reichlmayr on Tiger Center is found as Tom Reichlmayr on Rate My Professors.
