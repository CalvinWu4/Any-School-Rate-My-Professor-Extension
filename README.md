# Multi-College-Rate-My-Professor-Extension

This extension shows the [Rate My Professors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) rating of professors while searching classes on websites provided in a community-edited Airtable. 

### Description
Professors' names will now link to their Rate My Professors page (or the search results if not found). The most helpful rating is chosen as the most recent rating with the most net upvotes (regardless of the quality given). (The most helpful rating on Rate My Professors always has an "Awesome" overall quality.) Also, the "Would take again" value won't show up unless there are eight or more ratings and the majority of ratings answer that question. To better find professors, this extension will try all associated nicknames or diminutive names for first names from [here](https://github.com/carltonnorthern/nickname-and-diminutive-names-lookup).
